# Arduino MKR Projects for Schools
Arduino MKR is a colourful, introductory book that introduces learners to the exciting world of microcontrollers and the Internet of Things. Learners will use both simulators and physical devices to build systems and solve real-life problems. A variety of input and output devices will be used to receive instruction from the user, sense the environment, and display both status information and complex outputs.

The book takes a gradual approach to learning, with simulations and emulators used to build confidence, before learners begin constructing basic physical circuits. A variety of Internet services are applied to turn the devices into true Internet of Things devices, both to instruct the device to carry out a task and to report data from the device's sensors.

As well as stand-alone devices and those connected to the Internet of Things, learners will experience some other exciting modern technologies such as Machine Learning-based Artificial Intelligence using the popular Python language.

## Resource Aim
To introduce, inspire and engage learners to study Physical Computing as well as serving as an introduction to the pedagogy and resources offered in our full courses.

## Learning Outcomes
- Learners will understand and apply the fundamental computational techniques to solve contextualised problems
- Learners will apply computational techniques including abstraction, decomposition logic and algorithms
- Learners will become more confident in using the Arduino MKR to build Physical Computing projects
- Learners will understand how technology can be applied to the real world
  
## Resource structure
Arduino MKR is a series of individual projects that build in complexity.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.

Contact us at school@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
